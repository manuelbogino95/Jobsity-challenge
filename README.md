The goal of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React, Vue or Angular.

## Mandatory Features
- Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.
- Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- Ability to edit reminders – including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- Add a weather service call from a free API such as ​Open Weather Map​, and get the
weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- Unit test the functionality: ​Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

## Bonus (Optional)
- Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.
- Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- Functionality to delete one or ALL the reminders for a specific day.

## Instructions
